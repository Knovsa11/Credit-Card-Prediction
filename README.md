# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

This project was created to predict whether a customer will have their credit card defaulted in a month and the model is expected to minimize False Negatives (failed to pay but predicted otherwise) and suppress False Positives (not defaulted but predicted otherwise). The machine learning used is Supervised Classification Machine Learning. The algorithms used include KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Therefore, the metric used to measure the performance of this program (model) is F1 Score because it can see the harmonization of Precision and Recall. The dataset is obtained from Bigquery with the query in the notebook.
